# 1. Disclaimer
Note that this audit does not give any warranties on finding all possible security issues of the given smart contract(s), i.e., the evaluation result does not guarantee the nonexistence of any further findings of security issues. As one audit-based assessment cannot be considered comprehensive, we always recommend proceeding with several independent audits and a public bug bounty program to ensure the security of smart contract(s). Last but not least, this security audit should not be used as investment advice.

## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Classifications Used in This Audit

|Category| Summary|
|---|---|
|Configuration |Weaknesses in this category are typically introduced during the configuration of the software |
|Data Processing Issues |Weaknesses in this category are typically found in functionality that processes data. |
|Numeric Errors |Weaknesses in this category are related to improper calculation or conversion of numbers. |
|Security Features  |Weaknesses in this category are concerned with topics like authentication, access control, confidentiality, cryptography, and privilege management. (Software security is not security software.) |
|Time and State |Weaknesses in this category are related to the improper management of time and state in an environment that supports simultaneous or near-simultaneous computation by multiple systems, processes, or threads. |
|Error Conditions, Return Values, Status Codes |Weaknesses in this category include weaknesses that occur if a function does not generate the correct return/status code, or if the application does not handle all possible return/status codes that could be generated by a function. |
|Resource Management |Weaknesses in this category are related to improper management of system resources. |
|Behavioral Issues  |Weaknesses in this category are related to unexpected behaviors from code that an application uses. |
|Business Logic |Weaknesses in this category identify some of the underlying problems that commonly allow attackers to manipulate the business logic of an application. Errors in business logic can be devastating to an entire application. |
|Initialization and Cleanup |Weaknesses in this category occur in behaviors that are used for initialization and breakdown. |
|Arguments and Parameters |Weaknesses in this category are related to improper use of arguments or parameters within function calls. |
|Expression Issues |Weaknesses in this category are related to incorrectly written expressions within code. |
|Coding Practices |Weaknesses in this category are related to coding practices that are deemed unsafe and increase the chances that an exploitable vulnerability will be present in the application. They may not directly introduce a vulnerability, but indicate the product has not been carefully developed or maintained. |

# 3. Contracts overview

The purpose of this audit was to achieve the following:
* Formally check the logic behind given smart contracts.
* Identify potential security issues with smart contracts

> Information in this report should be used for understanding the risk exposure of smart contracts, and tas a guide to improving the security posture of smart contracts by remediating the issues that were identified.

The Jetton is deployed on mainnet TON at address:
